I am currently pursuing a PhD in Macroeconomics at the University of Lausanne. My research interests include applied macroeconomics (forecasting) and international macroeconomics and finance. Alongside my studies, I also work as an economic consultant for the Centre de Recherche Appliqu√©e (CREA) where I am responsible for the production and analysis of quarterly industry forecasts. I also write educational content for iconomix, the education platform of the Swiss National Bank. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as an intern for the Financial Stability Department of the Swiss National Bank in Bern.
