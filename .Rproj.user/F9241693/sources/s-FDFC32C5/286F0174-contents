I am currently pursuing a PhD in Macroeconomics at the University of Lausanne. My research interests include applied macroeconomics (forecasting) and international macroeconomics and finance. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as an intern for the Financial Stability Department of the Swiss National Bank in Bern. Besides that, I am an avid photographer.
