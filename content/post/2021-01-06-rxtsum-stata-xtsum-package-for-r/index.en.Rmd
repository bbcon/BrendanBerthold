```
devtools::install_github("Bridyshop/Rxtsum")
library(Rxtsum)
```


# A few words about Rxtsum

The package Rxtsum replicates the between/within standard deviation decomposition of Stata's xtsum package. In particular, it follows the procedure described here : http://stephenporter.org/files/xtsum_handout.pdf

It is used as follows:

```
Rxtsum(data, id, col)
```

Where data is a dataframe which can be grouped (for example panel data where the group is the individual), id is the grouping variable, and col is a character vector for which you want the within/between decomposition. Obviously, col have to be numeric.


An overview of the different functions of the package:

```
Rxtsum::Rxtsum(iris, Species, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"))
Rxtsum::f.between_df(iris, Species, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"))
Rxtsum::f.within_df(iris, Species, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"))
Rxtsum::f.overall_df(iris, Species, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"))
```
