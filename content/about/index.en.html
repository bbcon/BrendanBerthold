<p><img src="/pictures/mattherhorn-from-schwarzsee.jpg" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD in Macroeconomics at the University of Lausanne. My research interests include applied macroeconomics (forecasting) and international macroeconomics and finance. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as an intern for the Financial Stability Department of the Swiss National Bank in Bern. You can find my resume <a href="/pdf/CV_BB_simplified.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>This website is under construction.</p>
